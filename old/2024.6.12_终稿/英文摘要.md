In unstable neural networks, the gradient explosion and gradient vanishing problems limit the effectiveness of backpropagation algorithms. As the number of network layers and complexity increase, the gradient may grow exponentially or decay, resulting in numerical instability during training and degraded model performance. This paper reviews the theoretical foundations of unstable neural networks, including the concepts of Lyapunov spectrum and Lyapunov vector, which are used to describe the dynamic characteristics and stability of the system. The concepts of adjoint Lyapunov spectrum and duality are important for solving the gradient explosion problem.

In traditional backpropagation algorithms, solutions to the gradient explosion problem include gradient clipping and regularization techniques, but they have limited effects in unstable neural networks. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a new backpropagation method based on adjoint shadowing, which uses the information of the adjoint Lyapunov spectrum to adjust the propagation path and intensity of the gradient, effectively alleviating the gradient explosion problem. At the same time, the kernel differentiation method is introduced, and the stability and accuracy of the calculation are improved by introducing kernel functions to smooth the gradient calculation.

This paper analyzes the performance and limitations of traditional backpropagation algorithms in unstable neural networks at the theoretical level, and emphasizes the impact of the gradient explosion problem on parameter update and model training. The back propagation method based on adjoint shadow redefines the gradient update rule and verifies its effectiveness in different types of unstable neural networks through experiments. Experimental results show that this method significantly reduces the impact of gradient explosion and improves the convergence speed and performance stability of the model.

In order to verify the wide applicability of the method, this paper combines the kernel differential method with the adjoint shadow technology to construct a hybrid optimization algorithm. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional method, the new hybrid optimization algorithm has significant improvements in training speed, convergence and final model performance. This shows that the kernel differential method provides an additional smoothing effect when dealing with the gradient explosion problem, making the gradient update process more stable.

In summary, this paper proposes an innovative method to solve the gradient explosion problem in unstable neural networks through theoretical analysis and experimental verification. The combination of the back propagation method based on adjoint shadow and the kernel differential method provides new directions and ideas for future research and application. These research results not only deepen the understanding of the dynamic characteristics of unstable neural networks, but also provide new tools and methods for improving the back propagation algorithm.
